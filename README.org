#+title: Ruby Tree Sitter Mode

* Introduction

This is where I am going to keep notes as I develop the
~ruby-ts-mode.el~.

* Steps

I'm hoping not to forget some steps I did...

1) Initial set up:

   1. ~M-x treesit-install-language-grammar~
   2. Write =ruby= when prompted for the language.
   2. Answer ~y~ to building interactively.
   3. Paste =https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-ruby= when asked for the repo.
   4. Pick default answers for the remaining questions.
   5. Wait for the success message in the message area.

2) Loaded a Ruby file and did ~M-: (treesit-parser-create 'ruby)~
   which returned ~#<treesit-parser for ruby>~... I guess that's good.

3) ~(treesit-parser-list)~ to check the list of parsers for the
   current buffer.

4) ~M-x treesit-inspect-mode~ and it seemed happy.
